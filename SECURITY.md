How to Report a Potential Vulnerability?
========================================

If you would like to report a public issue (for example, one with a released
CVE number), please report it as a
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/quic/gunyah-test-vmm/issues/new).
If you have a patch ready, submit it following the same procedure as any
other patch as described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you are dealing with a not-yet released or urgent issue, please contact us
via our [Product Security team](mailto:product-security@qualcomm.com) or
see our 
[Report a Bug](https://www.qualcomm.com/company/product-security/report-a-bug)
page, including as many details as
possible: including the version, and any example code, if available.
